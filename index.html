<h4 id="interest">Interest in IT </h4>
<p>My interest in IT is primarily in IT security such as protecting and reducing vulnerabilities and preventing attacks of different natures, for example denial of service attacks or direct access attacks. The reason I find this aspect of IT so interesting is that it has such a wide variety of applications such as hardware protection, software development, testing for vulnerabilities, implementing security procedures, measures and counter-measures and many more. IT Security also has a large impact as well as it is so important for so many aspects of everyday life, from personal information privacy to protecting a company or businesses data.<br> My interest in IT started rather recently, only within the last year or so, when my brother first introduced the idea to me when I was trying to decide what I would like to study at university. He showed me the types of things I would learn to do as well as different career paths it could lead to, and I found that I was excited to learn more about these topics.</p>

<b><i>IT Experience</i></b>

<p>My IT experience is very limited at the moment as I have a basic understanding of some programming languages such as Java and HTML, as well as basic knowledge about different operating systems including Windows, Linux and MacOS. I also have some knowledge of databases and SQL.</p>

<b><i> Why I chose RMIT</i> </b>
<p>I initially considered RMIT for at the suggestion of my brother who is completing a Bachelor of Computer Science at RMIT and found RMIT to have good resources and coursework. I chose to come to RMIT after researching its CSIT department and courses and attending the open day as well as considering other factors such as transportation convenience.</p>

<b><i> What I Expect to Learn</i></b>

<p> I expect through the duration of my studies to develop my skills in programming and coding in a variety of programming languages as well as exploring different areas of IT such as security, coding, databases and more, to find out which one is best suited to me and therefore, which area I would like to find a job in. I would also expect to learn how to utilise these skills in order to gain necessary experience and find a job in the relevant field.

<b><i> Skills, Qualifications and Experience Required
For the Position</i></b>
<br><br>
<i><u>This position requires:</u></i>
<ul>
  <li>Tertiary qualification in IT of related field and or extensive experience</li>
  <li>Certified information Systems Security Professional CISSP, which would require passing an exam featuring a wide variety of knowledge of security such as security and risk management, asset security, security architecture and engineering, communication and network security, identity and access management, security assessment and testing, security operations and software development security</li>
  <li>Information Security Registered Assessor (IRAP) would be highly regarded

</ul>

<b><i> Skills, Qualifications and Experience I Currently Have</i></b>
<p>I am currently working towards gaining a tertiary qualification in Information Technology and in doing so currently gaining basic experience in the field. I have basic skills in programming and coding, as well as basic knowledge of databases, operating systems and very basic security knowledge. </p>
<b><i> My Plan to Obtain Skills, Qualifications and Experience For the Position </i></b>

<p>To gain the necessary experience for this position I would first need to complete my current Bachelors degree and possibly a Masters degree in IT, Computer science or Cyber Security although this was not explicitly a requirement for the position, it may aid in gaining experience. 
At some point during or after completing my degree I would need to find an entry level job preferably in the security field otherwise a job in the field of IT that could help find a job specialising in security. Once I have gained plenty experience, I would then try to move up from the position or find a position elsewhere that has a possibility of progression in the desired field. Once the necessary experience has been gained through this process, I would then be able to complete the certifications that are required for the job (the CISSP and likely the IRAP).

<i><b>Test Results</b></i>
<ul>
  <li>MBIT: ISTJ-T "The Logistician"<br><i>Introverted, Observant, Thinking, Judging - Turbulent</i></li>
  <li>Learning Style: Visual</li>
  <li>Big 5: </li>
</ul>
<p>Overall the test results show that I am introverted, observant, logical, practical, organised, conscientious and to a lesser extent emotionally stable and agreeable. The results indicate a propensity for facts, logic and organisation over feelings, flexibility and extroversion. The learning style results showed that I best learn visually meaning that I learn from reading text, diagrams through other visual mediums. In a team environment, these results would mean that I would be reliable, thorough and methodical ensuring an organised approach and that I would do my fair share of work in the team.This should be taken into account when forming a team by having team members that have some similar traits such as reliability and practicality. However team members should also not possess exactly the same traits so that a variety of opinions and approaches are discussed and utilised when working together.

<h6 id="idea">Project Idea</h6>

<i><b>Overview</b></i>
<p>My idea for a project is an app for managing ‘Secret Santa’s’. It would be a simple way for users to enter into a Secret Santa group, set a price limit, have a wish list, randomly allocate a ‘buyer’ to a ‘receiver’ and allow them to anonymously communicate for clarifications e.g. What colour would you prefer for item 3 on your list? Or Could you please specify what type of headphones you would like? The app would be very simple in terms of usability and would work for families, friends or in a workplace.</p>

<i><b>Motivation</b></i>
<p>The motivation behind this project is that often secret santa’s involve one person that has to organise and coordinate the different aspects of a secret santa. For example, normally someone involved in the secret santa will choose the names out of a hat (or some other method) and then tells each person who they are buying a present for and give them that person's wish list. This means that there will always be one person in the group that knows who everyones Secret Santa is. Another reason is that most secret santa apps simply randomise the names and offer no other real service. There are websites that offer these some of these services however most people would want to access their secret santa information on their phone. Eg looking at someone's wish list while shopping. An app would be a simple solution to this.</p>

<i><b>Description</b></i>
<p>The app would have 4 main functions including allocation, wish lists, groups and communication. <br><br>

The group function of the app would allow for people to create or join a Secret Santa group and be apart of multiple secret santa groups at once. For example, one person could be apart of a Secret Santa group with their friends and another group with their colleagues and this function would allow them to have separate group members, wish lists and spending limits. One person will create a group and invite people to join the group through an email. The person who created the group will set spending limit e.g. $50. Which could then be approved by other members of the group as they join.<br><br>

The allocation aspect of the app would be a simple randomization tool that randomly assigns each user another user to be a Secret Santa for, while prohibiting each user from receiving their own name as their secret santa. <br><br>

The app would also have an option to include wishlists. Wishlists would be a list of 3 to 10 items that people would like to receive from their secret santa as well as the option to include rough prices for each item. For example:<br><br>

User ‘A’ Wishlist:
<i>Book Title by Author Name  Price Estimate:$25</i> <br><br>

These lists would then be accessed by the chosen secret santa who could make notes on each item such as ‘this would be cheaper on amazon’ or ‘difficult to locate’, these notes would not be visible to the maker of the list. The purpose of this function would be to allow the secret santa to choose which item/s they will buy, how much the items cost from various places and compare items.<br><br>

Once the secret santa knows who they are buying for and have viewed the wishlist, they will also have access to a feature for anonymous communication with who they are buying for.The purpose of the communication function would be to clarify wishlist items or other relevant information. For example, if someone put ‘t-shirts’ on their wishlist the communication tool would allow the secret santa to ask questions such as ‘What size t-shirts?’ or ‘What address should I send your gift to?’ which would mean that the receiver would be more likely to receive what they would like while also not revealing who the secret santa is.
